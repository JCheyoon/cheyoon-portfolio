The second feature enables users to upload two signature images and utilize AI to compare the similarities between the two signatures.",

Additionally, while conducting manual testing, I had the opportunity to write a test log for the first time, and through this process, I discovered many bugs and realized the importance of testing.",
  "experience.project.review.p3": "In this project, I had to work with a REST API created using a specialized backend program called Matlab. Unlike the existing backend code, I had to handle complex nested data structures. it was difficult to determine where each piece of data was needed. To implement the graphs, I communicated extensively with the backend developer, and for the first time, I encountered CORS issues and learned how to resolve them.",
